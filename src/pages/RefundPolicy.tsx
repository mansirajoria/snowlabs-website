            <p>You are requested to raise the refund request before the beginning of the second session of the batch in which you are eligible to attend or after the completion of the second session of the batch. No amount would be refunded from the third session of the batch whether attended or not.</p>
            <p>Instead of the refund request, you can also raise a request for switching to another batch of the same training course or of any other course by paying the balance amount of fees, if applicable. If the other course is of less value balance amount would be kept by SnowLabs as your credit and can be used in the future for any other course opted by you after discussing with the SnowLabs management.

            <p>The eligible refund amount would be credited after deducting payment gateway charges/ transfer charges/ currency conversion charges or any other charges as may be applicable.</p>
            <p>If any batch is cancelled by SnowLabs due to instructor unavailability insufficient enrollments, or forced measures (like floods, earthquakes, national/ global pandemic, political instability, etc.), 100% of training/course fees will be refunded to the learner within 14 days.</p>

            <p>You can raise a refund request 7 days before the batch begins. We may need to postpone/cancel an event because of many reasons, such as insufficient enrollments, instructor unavailability, or force majeure events (like floods, earthquakes, political instability, etc). If we cancel an event, 100% of the training/course fees will be refunded to the learner. No refund is applicable to certification exams, you can switch between other certification exams with equal value.</p>
            <p>If a cancellation is done by an attendee, 7 days (or more) before the batch begins, payment gateway charges/transfer charges/currency conversion charges will be deducted and the remaining amount will be refunded to the learner.</p>
            <p>However, the learner can request any time before the training starts for switching to another batch or any other course on payment of balance fees, if applicable. If the other course is of less value balance amount would be kept by SnowLabs as your credit and can be used in the future for any other course opted by you after discussing with the SnowLabs management.</p>
